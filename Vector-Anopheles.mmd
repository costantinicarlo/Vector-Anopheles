## Why *Anopheles* mosquitoes transmit malarial *Plasmodia*?

Overall 360 species of *Anopheles*, only some 45 are seriously implicated in malaria transmission

Because of 4 factors:

1. Abundance

--

2. Contact with humans

--

3. Susceptibility to infection

--

4. Longevity

---

## Abundance

- Larval ecology

- Human activities

	- Irrigation

	- Deforestation (A. gambiae in Africa vs. A. balabacensis in South-East Asia)

	- Urbanisation

---

## How to estimate absolute abundance, and why?

- Quadrats

	- *A. pessoai* in Colombia grasslands: 1 000--2 500/ha  de Zulueta 1952

- Houses

	- *A. gambiae* and *A. funestus* in Tanzania: 1 000/ha (160 ha) Gillies 1955

- Mark-Release-Recapture

	- *A. gambiae s.l.* **females** in Burkina Faso: 375--875/ha (400 ha) Costantini 1996

	- *A. quadrimaculatus* 20 000--37 000/ha (160 ha) Eyles & Cox 1943

## Susceptibility to infection

Whenever sufficient stable conditions persist allowing contact among the vector, the host, and the parasite over prolonged periods of time, susceptibility to infection is almost never a bar to a species acting as a vector, provided it is sufficiently abundant, human-biting, and long-lived.

**Given enough time**, a parasite will **adapt** to the most prevalent human-biting mosquitoes of a particular region.

Land-use and climate changes, or human migrations introducing foreign parasite strains may limit the susceptibility of an otherwise potent vector.

*A. maculipennis*, *A. atroparvus*, and *A. labranchiae* in Europe failed to become infected with Indian or African strains of *P. falciparum* James 1932; Ramsdale & Coluzzi 1975

According to Bruce-Chwatt & de Zulueta (1980) *P. falciparum* did not invade the Mediterranean until it could adapt to *A. maculipennis* during the early centuries of the Christian era.

## Host selection 1

> The **proportion of feeds** that a species of *Anopheles* takes **on humans** is the single **most important** character determining its role as a **vector**. ---Gillies, 1988

Host-feeding patterns in mosquitoes can be **broadly** categorized in

1. species feeding on mammals (=> *Anopheles*)

2. species feeding on birds

3. species feeding on both mammals and birds

4. more esoteric (and often occasional) feeding habits: amphibians and reptiles (*Uranotenia* spp.), fishes (*Periophthalmus*), invertebrates (molluscs, arthropods)

---

## Host selection 2

- feral *Anopheles* do not feed either on humans or domestic animals

	- cave-dwelling species like *A. hamoni* feed on **bats** in Central Africa (Adam 1965)

	- *A. smithii* feed on **porcupines** and **fruit-bats** in West Africa (Mouchet 1957; Brady 1965)

	- *A. machardyi* feed on **antelopes** in East Africa (Gillies & de Meillon 1968)

	- *A. hackeri* and *A. pujutensis* feed on **monkeys** in Malaya (Reid & Weitz 1961)

	- *A. freeborni* and *A. franciscanus* feed on **hares** and wild **rabbits** in Western USA (Tempelis 1974)

- some species feeding on human or domestic animals in anthropic environments can feed on wildlife in feral habitats (Makanga)

2. Host availability

contact with humans is much closer if, in addition to feeding preferentially on them, a vector has the ability to penetrate indoors so that both early and late-feeding individuals or genotypes take part in transmission.

---

## 2. Host availability

> Many species of *Anopheles* will feed on whatever large mammal is available. For example in the Afrotropical anophelines fauna some 80% of species could be described in this way.

--

Factors affecting the probability of host contact:

1. Habitat overlap

	- forest workers (*A. dirus* in South-East Asia, *A. darlingi* in the Amazon forest)

	- urban *vs.* rural vectors (*A. stephensi* in India, *A. claviger* in Syria and Lebanon)

1. Relative abundance (density)

2. Size

---

## 3. Host accessibility


1. Indoors *vs.* outdoors

2. Under bed nets

3. Defensive behaviour

4. at ground *vs.* canopy level
